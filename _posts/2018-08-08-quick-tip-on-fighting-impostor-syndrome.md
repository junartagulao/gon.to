This is something that I've been talking a lot about with both people that work with me as well as my mom üë©‚Äçüë¶

Most times, because of anxiety and insecurities, *we always assume that other people think the worst of us.* This is a very known syntom of impostor syndrome:

"I'm sure they think I'm annoying when I constantly recommend things to improve"
"I'm pretty sure they didn't like what I presented based on their facial expressions"

Those assumptions are almost always incorrect, and they can be very easily solved: *Just ask the other person!*

Asking other people what they think is hard in an enviroment where there's no trust. This is why *vulnerability based trust is so important. If you have trust, you can just be direct and ask instead of assume the worst.*

Once you start asking and collecting answers from people that show your original thinking is incorrect, please STOP a minute, and check how wrong you were. This is "the reward" that's going to help you create a new habit of NOT assuming the worse and actually asking!
