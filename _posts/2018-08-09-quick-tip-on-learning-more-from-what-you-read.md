My best technique to better process and learn more from the books I read is obsessively tell different people what I've learnt.

People are going to ask questions about it, as well as go into discussions about it. I always learn something new in every conversation and the knowledge I get is saved deeper in my brain. At the same time, you help people by informing them of something new and making them think.

Such a great win-win situation!!!
